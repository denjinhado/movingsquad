Both hardworking, friendly and upbeat the entire time they were helping us move even in 90 degree heat. They were always smiling and positive while also carefully packing and moving our items into our U-Haul.",

        comment: "I needed a quick last minute move for my father from one assisted living facility to another. The furniture was only a small dresser, a small TV, 8 pieces of artwork, and 6 boxes. The moving squad was willing to work with me and actually saved me well over $100. They packaged and padded everything and got my dad moved in record time.",

        comment: "Felipe, his brother, and his cousin provided outstanding service with my move from a high rise apartment in Downtown San Diego to my house in Spring Valley. Even though the service elevator at my apartment was down, and even though my apartment was late by one hour in giving me my reserved elevator, Felipe's attitude never changed. ",

        comment: "To say I'm satisfied with the service they provide would be an understatement. Not only did they help me move the items I had originally contacted them about but they moved a lot more and helped me get rid of pieces and rearrange heavy things up and down stairs. They were so professional, polite, helpful, and kind.",
